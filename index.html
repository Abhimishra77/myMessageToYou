    <h1>Hey, I Know This Was Random…</h1>
    <p>
      I know it was a random request. And then we started talking, and it felt like a good thing.
      It was unexpected.<br><br>

      A few unexpected things happened, and most of the time it felt like we were on the same page.
      Maybe even our thinking felt the same.<br><br>

      I know it’s too early, but I just wanted to tell you that you are awesome.<br><br>

      Talking for five to six hours on the first day, and then waking up the next morning with you
      being the first thought — that meant something to me.<br><br>

      Thank you for this.
    </p>
